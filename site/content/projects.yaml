  description: Support provenance tracking and dataflow paradigm for highly-reproduceable research with minimal boilerplate. Just add type hints and decorators to your existing functions. Provenance tracking and serialization provided by [Sumatra](https://sumatra.readthedocs.io) and [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io) respectively. Units of work (“tasks”) can be exported as fully-contained, portable JSON files.

  description: |
    A collection of type hint specifiers for Python types common in the fields of scientific computing, data science and machine learning. Most types come with a pair of JSON serializer/deserializer functions, which can be used both to archive and transfer data.
    In contrast to pickling, the resulting files are both future safe and human readable, which makes them especially suitable to ensure [reproducibility](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html).

    Some supported data types:

    - `range`
    - NumPy arrays
    - NumPy random number generators
    - SciPy distributions
    - PyTorch tensors
    - Values with units (Pint)
