  about: |
    At university I studied both physics and mathematics, drawn by this seeming magical power of mathematics to achieve deep understanding of the natural world. This fascination continues to drive my research today.

    I entered computational neuroscience during my graduate studies, attracted to a field which seems to have unbounded potential for mathematization: brains are unimaginably complex biological systems, and simply cataloging their constituents will not suffice to explain how they work. Therefore we need effective models whose interactions we can understand in terms of mathematics.

    However exactly because these systems are so complex, creating models that are both accurate and understandable is very difficult. To address this, I develop computational tools which blend machine learning with classic dynamical systems theory. The goal is to learn models more expressive than what can be fitted using dynamical systems alone, but which still provide deep insights into the biology, in ways a pure deep learning approach cannot.
    More recently I have also looked for principles of computation in artificial deep neural networks.

    I believe strongly in FAIR and open research, and do my best to make my work reusable whenever possible.
